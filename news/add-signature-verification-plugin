### Enhancements

* Add `CondaPostSolve` plugin hook for signature verification, migrated from `conda.trust.signature_verification`. This enables automatic package signature verification when conda's `extra_safety_checks` is enabled and a trust root is installed (e.g., via `conda-anaconda-trust-root`). (#TBD)
* Add `verification` module with `_SignatureVerification` class for verifying package metadata signatures during conda's solve phase. (#TBD)
* Add `constants` module with `KEY_MGR_FILE` constant, migrated from `conda.trust.constants`. (#TBD)

### Deprecations

* None

### Docs

* None

### Other

* Add `pytest-mock` to test dependencies for the new verification tests. (#TBD)
